% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Experience}
\runsubsection{University of Rochester}
\descript{| Research Assistant }
\location{2012 - Present | Rochester, NY}
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Published four journal articles in quantum parameter estimation, with a strong emphasis on probability and statistics in theoretical physics.
\item Successfully aided experimental collaborators with difficult problems in situations where results were required very quickly, including
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Proving a quantum cryptography scheme was secure (with high probability) against eavesdropping attacks.
  \item Diagnosing a subtle problem where experimental data was not repeatable or consistent with models.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\runsubsection{RTI International}
\descript{| Independent Contractor}
\location{2012 - 2016 | Research Triangle Park, NC}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Performed an intensive technical and financial analysis to aid in the development of a medical physics invention.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Needed to quickly learn new concepts in nuclear physics, engineering, and finance.
  \item Successfully optimized the device and helped verify technical performance with simulations in C++.
  \item Also verified the device could be created an operated competitively using net present value and levelized cost analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\item Prepared documents and presentations for large funding proposals (\emph{e.g.}~for venture capital).
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\textbf{Note:} All work for the past 5 years has been on a full-time telecommuting basis as part of distributed teams.

\section{Projects}
\descript{\href{https://github.com/KMLDS/Bender}{Predicting NFL player statistics}}
\begin{tightemize} 
\item Created an application to predict fantasy football scores of current NFL players given a \href{https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb}{large Postgres database} of past statistics.
\item Large, nontrivial SQL queries were needed to take the data from its raw form to a useful state.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Query speeds were greatly increased using materialized views and window functions.
  \end{itemize}
\item Optimized with respect to a number of algorithms on players of each position, including $k$-nearest neighbors, ridge regression, support vector regression, and feedforward neural networks.
\item Current results compared against anecdotal evidence available online suggest the model can outperform average human fantasy football players, and likely even have a positive expected return on fantasy football bets.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Performance measures of predicted lineups will be made concrete by scraping data from available fantasy football contests to determine the actual distribution of scores.
  \end{itemize}
